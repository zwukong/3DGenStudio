## ✨ Features

Switch between **Kanban** and **Graph** views to manage and visualize your entire 3D production pipeline in the way that suits your style.

### 📋 Kanban Board
Manage your 3D assets as cards flowing through automated pipeline stages — `Images` → `Image Edit` → `Mesh Gen` → `Mesh Edit` → `Texturing`.
- 🗂️ **Drag-and-drop** cards between pipeline stages
- 🎠 **In-card image carousel** with variant browsing
- ⚡ **Per-card ComfyUI & API** action triggers
- 🏷️ **Custom attributes** & metadata tagging

### 🕸️ Node Graph
Visualize the relationships between your assets as a node graph. Connect image sources to edit nodes, mesh generators, and export pipelines.
- 👁️ **Visual node-based** asset relationships
- 🔍 **Click any node** to open the inspector panel
- 🎛️ **ComfyUI workflow parameters** inline
- 🚀 **Start workflows** with one click

### 📚 Assets Library
A centralized library for all your images, meshes, and ComfyUI workflows. Browse, filter, and import assets directly into any project.
- 📦 **Unified view:** Images, Meshes, Workflows
- ⏱️ **Version tracking** per asset
- 📥 **One-click import** into project
- 📄 **File format badges** (PNG, GLB, OBJ, EXR)

### 🔌 Powerful Integrations
-  **ComfyUI Native:** Run any ComfyUI workflow directly from a card or node. Pass dynamic parameters, capture outputs, and chain results automatically.
-  **External API Support:** Integrate any REST or GraphQL API. Tag cards with API endpoints and trigger generation via any 3rd party 3D service.

### 💾 Local-First Storage
Projects are stored as locally on disk — Git-syncable, portable across machines, and strictly no cloud lock-in.

## 🚀 Workflow

Each stage feeds the next. Use **ComfyUI** workflows or external APIs at any step — the results automatically flow to the next card in your board!

1. **Create / Import an Image:** Start with a text-to-image generation via ComfyUI, import an existing asset, or use an external API. Results land in the Images column.
2. **Edit & Refine:** Apply image edits — inpainting, normal map generation, background removal. Cards automatically move to Image Edit.
3. **Generate 3D Mesh:** Trigger a mesh generation workflow (e.g. TripoSR, Wonder3D). GLB/OBJ output moves the card to Mesh Gen.
4. **UV & Texture:** Run automatic UV unwrapping and texture projection workflows. Layer multiple textures, apply normal maps, and preview results.
5. **Export & Publish:** Export your finished mesh as GLB, OBJ, or EXR directly to your library. Track real-time status in the Action Log.

1. **Texturing:** With ComfyUI, improve the details of your texture directly on the mesh or change it completely for your needs.
2. **Modeling:** Basic features to edit the faces and vertices of your mesh, fix issues.
3. **Sculpting:** Basic sculpting features (Standard, Clay, Inflate, Smooth, Flatten, Pinch, Grab).
4. **Painting:** Paint directly on your mesh using brushes/images.
